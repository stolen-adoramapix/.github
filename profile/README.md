<h2>Purpose of AdoramaPix / Printique</h2>
<p><strong>AdoramaPix</strong> started in 1998 as an online photo‑printing lab affiliated with the photography retailer Adorama. Its purpose was to allow both professional photographers and casual users to create, customize and order high‑quality photo prints, photo books, albums, wall art and other photo products - all via an online interface. In 2019 the service was rebranded and its operations continue under the name <strong>Printique</strong>.</p>

<h2>Main Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Photo books and albums</strong> - Users can upload photos, arrange layouts, add text, choose covers, and order hardcover or softcover photo books, with lay‑flat page options for panoramic spreads.</li>
  <li><strong>Prints & wall art</strong> - Order standard photo prints, large-format prints, canvas, acrylic or metal‑backed prints for display.</li>
  <li><strong>Online editor (web-based)</strong> - No need to install separate software: layout creation and photo‑book design happens via web browser using the service's built‑in "PixPublisher" editor.</li>
  <li><strong>Flexible customization</strong> - Multiple page sizes, paper types, cover types (hardcover, leather, softcover), layout templates, backgrounds, frames, and text styles give wide creative freedom.</li>
  <li><strong>Photo upload & storage options</strong> - Users can upload directly from their computer or import from external photo‑sharing / cloud services; previously, integration with wireless memory cards (like from Eye‑Fi) was supported.</li>
  <li><strong>High‑quality printing</strong> - Prints and photo books are produced using professional-grade materials and printing processes rather than consumer‑grade inkjet, which results in more vivid colors, durable prints, and higher quality final products.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Unique Strengths</h2>
<p>What made AdoramaPix stand out was its blend of professional‑grade printing quality and web‑based convenience - letting both pros and hobbyists produce physical photo books or wall art without needing specialized software or photo‑lab access. Its rebranding as Printique also came with an expanded product range (canvas, acrylic, metal prints) and updated web interface while retaining its legacy of quality print products.</p>

<h2>Target Audience</h2>

</ul>

<h2>Supported Platforms & Technical Requirements</h2>
<p>AdoramaPix / Printique is a web-based service - no dedicated desktop application required. Users only need a modern web browser and internet connection to upload photos, design layouts, and order prints. On the production side, the printing lab handles actual printing, so no special hardware is needed on the user side beyond typical PC or Mac for web browsing.</p>

<h2>History and Rebranding</h2>
<p>The service began as AdoramaPix in 1998, operated by photography retailer Adorama. Over two decades it established itself as a reputable online photo‑printing lab serving both amateurs and professionals. In 2019 the company rebranded to <strong>Printique</strong>, retaining its printing services and expanding product offerings, modernizing its interface and updating its brand identity.</p>

<h2>Limitations & Considerations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Because the service is web-based and mail‑order, design editing happens online - offline editing or local software is not part of the basic offering. Users depend on the web interface performance and their internet connection. </li>
  <li>Turnaround time and shipping cost - printing and delivery may take several days depending on order, location and shipping method. </li>
  <li>For heavy customization or large orders, cost can be significant compared to DIY printing. </li>
  <li>Because AdoramaPix has rebranded to Printique, some older links or references to "AdoramaPix" may be outdated - users should use Printique's current site. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Typical Scenarios & Use Cases</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Creating a wedding album or photo book to preserve memories in high quality. </li>
  <li>Producing family photo albums, baby books, travel books or annual photo books. </li>
  <li>Printing high‑quality photos for framing, wall art, or gifts (canvas, metal or acrylic prints). </li>
  <li>Professional photographers ordering prints or albums for clients (portraits, events, portfolios). </li>
  <li>Photographers or hobbyists wanting archival‑quality prints with good color accuracy and long lifespan. </li>
  <li>People looking for easy-to-use online tool for layout design - no need for specialized desktop publishing software. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Why AdoramaPix / Printique Matters</h2>
<p>In an age where most photos remain digital and unseen, AdoramaPix (now Printique) provides a bridge from pixels to physical prints - transforming digital memories into tangible, high‑quality photo books, albums, wall art and keepsakes. For both casual users and professionals, it offers a reliable, quality‑focused service that combines convenience (online design & ordering) with craftsmanship (professional printing, archival‑grade materials). The rebranding to Printique reflects its evolution while maintaining its core mission: give users a way to preserve and celebrate their photos in print. </p>
